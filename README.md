# CryptoMesh

**Decentralized Payment & Reputation Layer for Mesh Networks**

## Project Description
CryptoMesh is a smart contract protocol that enables decentralized mesh network participants (nodes) to get paid in cryptocurrency for relaying data packets while building on-chain reputation based on their reliability and activity.

Instead of relying on centralized ISPs, devices in a CryptoMesh network forward traffic for each other and earn tokens automatically — creating economic incentives for a truly decentralized internet.

## Project Vision
To power the next generation of decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePIN) by providing a fair, transparent, and token-incentivized system for mesh networking. Eventually, anyone with a router or mobile device can become a micro-ISP and earn passive income while expanding global connectivity.

## Key Features
- **Node Registration** – Any wallet can register as a mesh node
- **Micropayment for Packet Relay** – Pay and get paid instantly for forwarding data
- **On-Chain Reputation System** – Honest and active nodes gain higher reputation (used for routing priority & higher rewards in future versions)
- **Instant Reward Claiming** – No lockups; claim earned funds anytime
- **Fully Transparent** – All relays and reputation changes are public on-chain

## Future Scope
- Integrate off-chain signed relay proofs (using BLS signatures or zero-knowledge proofs)
- Dynamic pricing based on network congestion and node reputation
- Staking mechanism for guaranteed bandwidth SLAs
- Cross-chain support (Layer 2 rollups, Solana, etc.)
- Integration with real mesh protocols (e.g., Helium, Althea, WiFi-DAB)
- Governance token and DAO for protocol upgrades
